## Overview

[What the system does and the shape of its architecture in a paragraph. The one-sentence version of
everything below.]

## System Context

[What sits outside the boundary: users, upstream and downstream systems, external services. What
crosses the line in each direction.]

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User] --> S[This system]
    S --> X[External service]
```

## Architecture

[The internal structure, and the reasoning behind the seams. Group with `subgraph` only where a real
boundary exists — a process, a deployment unit, a network zone. A subgraph drawn for tidiness reads
as an architectural claim.]

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph api[API layer]
        H[Handlers]
    end
    subgraph domain[Domain]
        S[Services]
    end
    H --> S
```

[A paragraph on what to look at: which boundaries are load-bearing, which are conventional.]

## Components and Responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

[One subsection per component whose internals matter to someone changing it.]

## Main Flows

[The paths worth tracing end to end. One diagram each, plus prose. Sequence when actors exchange
messages over time; flowchart when the branching is the point.]

### [Flow name]

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant S as Service
    C->>S: request
    S-->>C: response
```

## Data Model

[Entities and their relations. Draw only relations the sources establish — an inferred cardinality on
an ER diagram is read as verified and built upon. Where a relation exists but its cardinality was not
established, say so instead of picking the usual one.]

```mermaid
erDiagram
    A ||--o{ B : has
```

## External Integrations

| System | Direction | Protocol | Purpose | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Deployment

[Where it runs, what it runs as, how it scales. Include only what the sources confirm — deployment is
the section most often filled from convention.]

## Cross-cutting Concerns

[Authentication, authorization, logging, observability, error handling, transactions, caching —
whichever cut across components rather than living in one.]

## Constraints

[What the architecture is bound by: compatibility, latency, compliance, team, history. Constraints
explain shapes that otherwise look like mistakes.]

## Known Limitations

[Where the design strains, what it does not handle, what is known debt. Distinguish deliberate
trade-offs from accidents.]

## Summary

[The structure in a few lines, the parts that matter most, and the constraints a reader must respect
when changing it.]
