## Executive Summary

[What was done and where it stands, for someone who reads nothing else. Three or four sentences, no
jargon they would have to look up.]

## Scope

**In scope:** [what this covers]

**Out of scope:** [what was deliberately not part of it, and where it lives]

## Timeline

| Date / Period | Milestone |
|---|---|

## Major Changes

| Change | Area | Impact |
|---|---|---|

[Expand below only the changes whose consequences are not obvious from the table.]

## Architecture Changes

[Structural changes: new components, moved boundaries, removed pieces. What someone with the old
mental model would now get wrong.]

## Features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Consequence |
|---|---|---|

[A decision that will be questioned later deserves its own ADR, linked from here.]

## Problems Encountered

[What went wrong, what it cost, and how it was resolved — including the problems that are still
unresolved. A report where everything went smoothly is a summary of the plan, not of the work, and it
is the section that saves the next person the most time.]

## Testing and Validation

[What was verified and how, plus what was not. The gaps are the part a reader needs.]

## Current State

[Where things stand as of this report: what is done, deployed, in review, blocked. Date it — this
section is the first to go stale.]

## Technical Debt

| Item | Why it was accepted | Cost of leaving it |
|---|---|---|

## Open Work

| Item | Why it is open | Who / when |
|---|---|---|

## Summary

[What was accomplished, what is binding on future work, and what the next person should pick up
first.]
