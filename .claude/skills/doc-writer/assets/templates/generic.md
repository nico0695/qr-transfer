## Overview

[What this is about and why it exists, in a paragraph. A reader who stops here should still have the
right idea.]

## Context

[What the reader needs to know before the substance: the situation, the constraints, what was already
true. Cut this section if the overview already carries it.]

## [Content section]

[The substance. Shape these sections around the material and the reader's task — this template has no
opinion about how many there are or what they are called. Use tables for homogeneous comparable
information and diagrams for non-linear relationships; skip both when prose is clearer.]

## Open Questions

[What the sources did not establish, and what would settle it. Delete the section only if there is
genuinely nothing open.]

| Question | Why it matters | Who could answer |
|---|---|---|

## References

[Sources this document was built from: files, PRs, specs, conversations. What a reader follows to
verify a claim.]

## Summary

[What this documents, what matters most in it, what is binding, and what the reader should now know.
A landing, not a replay.]
